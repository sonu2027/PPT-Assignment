Q.1 What are hooks in react? how to identify hooks?

Ans. In React, hooks are functions that allow you to add state and other React features to functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8 as a way to use stateful logic and other React features without using class components. Hooks provide a more concise and straightforward way to manage component state and lifecycle.

To identify hooks in your React code, follow these guidelines:
A. Hooks always start with the use prefix, followed by the hook name (e.g., useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.).

B. Hooks can only be used in functional components or other custom hooks. They cannot be used in class components.

C.The rules of hooks mandate that hooks should always be called at the top level of a functional component. Do not call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
