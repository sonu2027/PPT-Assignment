Q.5  What is Mongoose and how does it relate to MongoDB?

Ans. Mongoose is an Object-Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js that provides a higher-level abstraction and a schema-based approach to interact with MongoDB databases. It is designed to work with MongoDB and simplifies the process of defining and working with data models in Node.js applications.

In MongoDB, data is stored in the form of documents (JSON-like BSON format), and each document can have its own structure. While MongoDB is a schema-less database, Mongoose introduces a schema, allowing you to define the structure of your data in a more organized and consistent way.
