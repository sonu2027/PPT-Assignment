Q.3 Explain SetTimeOut and setInterval ?

Ans. setTimeout:
The setTimeout function is used to execute a specified block of code once, after a specified delay. It takes two parameters: a function to be executed and a delay time in milliseconds. After the specified delay, the function is called and executed.

Example usage of setTimeout: 
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Message will be displayed after 2 seconds.");
}, 2000);


setInterval:
The setInterval function is used to repeatedly execute a specified block of code at a fixed interval. It takes two parameters: a function to be executed and a time interval in milliseconds. The function is executed repeatedly until it is stopped or the page is unloaded.

setInterval(function() {
  console.log("Message will be displayed every 5 seconds.");
}, 5000);
