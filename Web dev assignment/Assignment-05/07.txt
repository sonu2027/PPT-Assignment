07. Whatâ€™s async & await Keyword in JavaScript

Ans. The async and await keywords are part of the asynchronous programming features introduced in JavaScript to simplify the handling of promises and make asynchronous code appear more like synchronous code.

a. async: The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function. It can be placed before a function declaration, function expression, or arrow function. An async function always returns a promise, and the value it resolves to is determined by the return value of the function.

b. await: The await keyword can only be used inside an async function. It pauses the execution of the async function until a promise is fulfilled and returns the fulfilled value. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a more sequential and synchronous-like manner
