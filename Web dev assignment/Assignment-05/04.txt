Q.4 how can you handle Async code in JavaScript ?

Ans.  some commonly used approaches for handling asynchronous code:

Callbacks: Callbacks are a traditional way of handling asynchronous code in JavaScript. A callback function is passed as an argument to an asynchronous function. When the asynchronous operation completes, the callback function is invoked, allowing you to handle the result.

Promises: Promises provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous operations. Promises represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and allow chaining of operations using .then() and .catch() methods.

Async/await: This is a modern approach to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript. It provides a syntactic sugar on top of promises, making asynchronous code look more like synchronous code, which can improve readability and maintainability.
